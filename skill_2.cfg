echo Ran skill_2.cfg , no any settings in file for Normal level.


//skill_2.cfg settings inside are same as plugin 'asw-exec-skills.smx'
//asw_level_lock have the same asw-exec-skills.smx functions , now Ch1ckenscoop no longer need this plugin anymore.
 
//!! DON'T try to enable asw_level_lock & asw-exec-skills.smx at the same time to prevent setting error!!
